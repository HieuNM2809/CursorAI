Hey welcome back.

00:00.800 --> 00:05.180
And in this video we're going to have a look at two websites that can help you easily create diagrams

00:05.180 --> 00:06.740
to code implementations.

00:06.740 --> 00:10.850
We first have Excalidraw where we can create mock UI diagrams.

00:10.850 --> 00:12.530
And we also have v0.

00:12.560 --> 00:17.810
V0 is a product that's made by Vercel that helps you to generate UIs quickly directly from text.

00:17.840 --> 00:23.990
We can combine these two tools to take diagrams immediately put these into V0 to create high quality

00:23.990 --> 00:24.890
react components.

00:24.890 --> 00:28.550
For example, I can diagram and mock out my existing wireframes.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.100
So I'm going to have a logo in the top left.

00:31.820 --> 00:34.790
Then I'm going to have a navigation bar here.

00:36.380 --> 00:37.910
We'll call that navigation.

00:38.750 --> 00:44.960
And then I'm going to have a sidebar here and a sidebar.

00:46.160 --> 00:47.750
And I'm just going to put some links here.

00:47.750 --> 00:48.500
Link.

00:48.710 --> 00:49.820
Link one.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.100
Link two.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.310
Also let's have a main content section here.

00:55.550 --> 01:03.380
And let's have some cards with a title and also a description.

01:04.400 --> 01:13.580
And then I'm just going to group these together and make a couple of these just to left click and hover

01:13.610 --> 01:14.960
over the entire diagram.

01:14.960 --> 01:21.680
And then after that go to the hamburger menu in the top left click on Export Image and then we'll click

01:21.710 --> 01:24.800
a PNG and click save.

01:24.830 --> 01:26.410
Now we've saved that to the desktop.

01:26.410 --> 01:28.090
We're going to go back to V0.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.760
Make sure that you log into V0.

01:30.790 --> 01:34.390
After you've logged in, I'm going to suggest you write a prompt something like this.

01:34.390 --> 01:37.750
I want you to generate a very good dashboard interface using an image.

01:37.750 --> 01:41.530
Make it use Shadchan, radix UI and also Next.js app router.

01:41.530 --> 01:46.510
We're then going to go and attach a file and we're going to attach the new PNG.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.100
Then we're going to click on the arrow.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.240
Or you can just hit enter.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.290
And then V0 is going to come up with a custom dashboard interface.

01:53.290 --> 01:57.190
That's based on the sketch that you've done inside of the Excalidraw tool.

01:57.190 --> 02:03.610
And this also allows you to see what the existing dashboard code would look like, as well as also providing

02:03.610 --> 02:05.530
you with the code implementation.

02:05.530 --> 02:10.240
So you can see both the preview of what that dashboard component looks like.

02:10.240 --> 02:15.430
And as well as that, you can also look at the code implementation and you can copy the code implementation.

02:15.430 --> 02:20.290
And notice how it's also using all of the components that we've recommended from last side, react and

02:20.290 --> 02:25.750
also shadow UI to quickly import your component directly into a Next.js application.

02:25.750 --> 02:32.020
Also go to the top right click on the add to codebase and then you can use this mpx Shad add command,

02:32.020 --> 02:36.880
which will directly import a V0 component into your application.

02:37.300 --> 02:37.900
Okay, cool.

02:37.900 --> 02:41.620
Hopefully this shows you how you can easily mock prototypes directly from images.

02:41.650 --> 02:44.650
I recommend taking some time out to practice this activity.

02:44.680 --> 02:49.960
Mock out a diagram of a UI component that you want to create, and then take that image and build it

02:49.960 --> 02:50.830
using V0.
