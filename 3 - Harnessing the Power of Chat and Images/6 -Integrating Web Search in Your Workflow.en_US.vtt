Hey welcome back.

00:00.950 --> 00:05.360
And this is just a quick video talking about some other different types of app references that you might

00:05.360 --> 00:06.380
want to consider.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.380
There is folders and files that we've had a look at.

00:09.620 --> 00:12.710
There is also codebase which we use your entire codebase.

00:12.740 --> 00:13.970
We've had a look at docs.

00:13.970 --> 00:20.450
You could also use git repositories or the web, and the web could be used for finding customer API

00:20.480 --> 00:21.440
documentation.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.900
Or you could say, you know, like you know what?

00:23.930 --> 00:31.550
What has happened, what has happened recently within a chain, right?

00:31.580 --> 00:34.220
So you could even ask a generic web query.

00:34.220 --> 00:38.570
But the important thing is that cursor will actually make a query.

00:38.600 --> 00:41.750
It will visit those web pages, it will read those web pages.

00:41.750 --> 00:46.100
And then you can see it's actually providing a more detailed response.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.380
So you can use this for both web based search.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.260
But you can also use this for pulling in custom documentation.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.790
So you could provide web links.

00:52.790 --> 00:55.070
And then it could be able to read those web links.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.480
Let's give that a test right now.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.210
So I've got at web and then I've got an article here.

00:59.210 --> 01:00.350
So you can see this.

01:00.560 --> 01:06.260
So you can add in an article and say what is happening in this article.

01:10.310 --> 01:13.250
So it talks about blundering and games startup failures.

01:13.250 --> 01:15.740
So obviously this is the full article.

01:15.770 --> 01:18.770
Other things you could do is pull in custom documentation.

01:18.770 --> 01:23.900
If there's a specific couple of web pages that you're going to need within your projects to help make

01:23.930 --> 01:30.320
sure that you've got the right documentation, you could include these via web or app links references.

01:30.320 --> 01:36.080
The important thing here is that might be more accurate than, for example, always indexing the entire

01:36.080 --> 01:40.550
documentation because you can say these specific files make sure to include these.

01:40.580 --> 01:40.910
All right.

01:40.910 --> 01:41.360
Cool.

01:41.390 --> 01:41.930
The next one.
