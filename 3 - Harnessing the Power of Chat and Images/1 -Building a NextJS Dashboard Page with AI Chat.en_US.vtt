00:00.020 --> 00:00.290
Hi.

00:00.290 --> 00:00.920
Welcome back.

00:00.920 --> 00:06.200
And in this video we're going to have a look at how we can debug and set up a dashboard implementation

00:06.200 --> 00:08.420
inside of react using Next.js.

00:08.420 --> 00:14.120
We're also going to be using the chat window to specifically fix bits of the navigation.

00:14.120 --> 00:22.490
So before starting this video, the only thing I've done is I have basically made a new Next.js application,

00:22.490 --> 00:24.680
and I've done that directly from the documentation.

00:24.680 --> 00:30.380
Additionally, we have a couple of components such as charts, dashboard, and as well as that we also

00:30.380 --> 00:34.880
have a dashboard route in the app component, which we can put here.

00:35.540 --> 00:39.350
Now the thing that we need to fix is we need to fix all of these imports.

00:39.350 --> 00:45.350
So for example, you can see we can't find the module of UI cards and its and its corresponding type

00:45.350 --> 00:46.280
declarations.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.750
And one thing we can do, which is a really good feature of cursor, is you can click on this eye fix

00:50.750 --> 00:51.440
in chat.

00:51.440 --> 00:56.750
And then what it will do is it will specifically tell you exactly what you need to run to get this to

00:56.780 --> 00:57.260
work.

00:57.260 --> 00:59.360
So I could try and I can even click run.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.030
And you can see it's doing.

01:01.210 --> 01:06.670
NP Shad UI latest add card and it says the configuration is is missing.

01:06.670 --> 01:12.460
So we could paste this back into the chat window and see what cursor gives us as the next thing.

01:12.460 --> 01:16.720
And as you can see here, we can actually then as well click run on this as well.

01:16.720 --> 01:23.320
And then that will run and install Shad CN, which we can then put into our project inside of the app.

01:23.320 --> 01:28.210
Now if we then go and run this command again, you can see it will then add the card.

01:28.210 --> 01:31.210
And then if you have a look here, we've now fixed our error.

01:31.240 --> 01:36.280
Let's have a look at some of the other components and see whether or not these are working.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.170
So you can see we've also got a problem here.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.770
Can't find module or type declarations.

01:41.770 --> 01:45.850
And then as well as that we could also see that these are the commands we need to run.

01:45.850 --> 01:48.130
So I can install the Richards package.

01:48.130 --> 01:50.710
And for mine I'm just going to run with sudo for now.

01:50.740 --> 01:53.920
And then as you can see here we can then install the types.

01:53.950 --> 01:57.370
Another way you can do this is you can load your problems tabs.

01:57.370 --> 02:01.870
And then you can put all of these into your specific window of the chart.

02:02.230 --> 02:03.370
And then you can see here.

02:03.370 --> 02:06.040
So what we're doing is we're sort of adding all of these.

02:06.070 --> 02:08.470
We're having a look looking for unique errors.

02:08.470 --> 02:09.220
That one here.

02:09.220 --> 02:11.710
That react icon looks like a unique error.

02:11.740 --> 02:12.670
What else have we got.

02:12.670 --> 02:16.120
Anything a UI button that looks like a unique error.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.310
So we're sort of going through the code.

02:18.310 --> 02:26.140
And we are looking for unique errors that we are basically populating directly inside of cursor.

02:26.140 --> 02:26.980
And then cursors.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.880
Now got all of these errors and it can walk through how we can fix this.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.220
So we've done this react types.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.570
We can probably run that.

02:34.570 --> 02:36.760
So we've already installed the charts package.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.080
We've installed that.

02:38.110 --> 02:42.520
We need to update the overall chart file to import react.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.630
So that will be in the dashboard overview chart.

02:46.630 --> 02:50.410
So in here then we need to import react.

02:50.410 --> 02:53.710
And then then let's have a look see what errors have we got now.

02:53.710 --> 02:57.010
So can't find these dashboard headers.

02:58.030 --> 02:59.710
So what have we got here.

02:59.710 --> 03:02.100
So I'm looking and fixing these errors.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.260
So if we're in let's have a look.

03:04.260 --> 03:09.090
So this might be where we actually have fixed most of the problems.

03:09.240 --> 03:16.050
And just restarting cursor was enough to restart the TypeScript web server which has now fixed all of

03:16.050 --> 03:16.710
the problems.

03:16.710 --> 03:20.730
So let's try bundling up this app and seeing what we have running on here.

03:20.790 --> 03:26.580
After loading the application, you can see that we have a failed to compile build error and it's telling

03:26.580 --> 03:29.430
us that we can't find this components UI button.

03:29.430 --> 03:31.560
This is probably a CDN issue.

03:31.560 --> 03:37.620
So let's go and dump this error directly into the eye chat window and see what cursor comes up with

03:37.650 --> 03:38.850
as they fix.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.750
So I've dumped in the error now and on the right hand side and you can see this.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.600
And then what we can see is we need to install the buttons.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.750
And we also if the component exists up your take your thing.

03:48.750 --> 03:53.970
So what I think we need to do is let's have a look in our components UI.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.620
We don't have the button.

03:55.620 --> 04:01.370
So we can say I don't have the button Component.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.470
How do I add it.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.140
And again we're using the shadow files.

04:06.140 --> 04:08.840
So you can see this is how we can add the button.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.050
So then it's giving us the bash commands that we can then click run.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.460
Close this down.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.230
And then what I'm going to do.

04:15.260 --> 04:16.190
So instead.

04:16.220 --> 04:20.300
So now we can just click apply on the shadow UI.

04:20.630 --> 04:21.590
Click run.

04:21.590 --> 04:24.230
And that will then install the button component.

04:24.230 --> 04:27.020
And then let's try and run the application again.

04:27.050 --> 04:27.350
All right.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.580
So we've run into another error.

04:28.610 --> 04:29.720
Fantastic times.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.270
So it looks like we don't have these react icons.

04:32.270 --> 04:35.060
So again this is something we can directly copy and paste.

04:35.060 --> 04:39.080
Let's go and put that inside of the chat and then see how cursor works with this.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.950
And obviously I'm going to encourage you to really read through and understand these errors.

04:42.950 --> 04:47.960
But again it looks like we're missing a React Icons package from the rails UI.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.600
So we'll click run on that and install that.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.710
And then we'll also rerun the web server and have a go and see if that then works.

04:54.740 --> 04:55.400
All right cool.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.640
So we've got our dashboard live and we've fixed all the errors.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.650
And you can see we've got some really nice components.

05:00.650 --> 05:03.710
If we reload it here, we've got this like nice transition.

05:03.710 --> 05:07.160
And again you've got things like the sails the active now.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.380
So we've got some data here which looks really really great.

05:09.410 --> 05:15.620
Now one thing we want to do is we want to fix the light mode and dark mode on our components.

05:15.620 --> 05:19.490
So firstly we're going to show you about the files and folder context.

05:19.490 --> 05:21.170
So I'm going to start a new chat.

05:21.170 --> 05:26.390
And be aware that when you start a new chat, you can still go and visit your previous chats by clicking

05:26.390 --> 05:31.820
on the button to the right of that as well as that, once we create a new chat, you can see that it's

05:31.820 --> 05:37.310
using the code base context, which is doing, which is basically using the ability to search the code

05:37.340 --> 05:41.360
base as well as that you could also give it the files that you need.

05:41.360 --> 05:45.200
So we're really interested in the fact that we want to add light mode.

05:45.230 --> 05:51.050
And one way we can do that is we know we probably need to maybe configure the tailwind config file and

05:51.050 --> 05:54.290
also maybe the layouts file, the route layout.

05:54.290 --> 05:57.470
So we're putting in these files and we're doing that with the At symbol.

05:57.470 --> 06:02.350
And you can see here there's lots of different files and folders and other things that we can add such

06:02.350 --> 06:05.170
as code, web docs, git, and codebase.

06:05.170 --> 06:10.360
And so what we're doing here is we're being able to say, I want to specifically pick these files,

06:10.360 --> 06:15.400
and I want to say I want to implement light and dark mode.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.710
Can you help with this?

06:17.740 --> 06:22.060
And then what we're doing is we're passing in those files as well as the current file.

06:22.060 --> 06:24.970
And it's telling us exactly the changes that we need to make.

06:24.970 --> 06:26.440
So we can click apply.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.810
And then we can see I don't want to delete this.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.280
We've just rejected that right there.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.380
And then we're going to go back.

06:32.380 --> 06:33.550
Here we go.

06:33.580 --> 06:36.880
Dark mode class satisfies config.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.470
That looks fine.

06:38.470 --> 06:42.160
We then need to create a theme toggle dot tsx.

06:42.160 --> 06:52.390
I would generally take this and then I would go into there and go theme toggle dot TSX.

06:52.750 --> 06:53.920
We paste that in.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.920
And then we've got a problem where we don't have next themes.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.570
We then need to update the layout.

06:58.570 --> 07:00.360
I just generally copy this.

07:00.360 --> 07:06.150
And then I go into the layout which is here, and then we can update that.

07:06.180 --> 07:11.520
Now the next thing you know we've got a problem is and I've just spelt the theme toggle wrong.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.400
So let's go and make sure that's correct which is fixed that one.

07:14.400 --> 07:20.340
But we've now running into the problems here which is we don't have next themes.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.290
So let's go and install that.

07:22.290 --> 07:25.590
And we can see sometimes you don't even need to use cursor right.

07:25.590 --> 07:28.350
We just know that we need to install the next themes package.

07:28.350 --> 07:31.620
And we also need a theme provider as well.

07:31.650 --> 07:33.420
So the theme provider is here.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.040
So I will also go and create that.

07:35.040 --> 07:40.590
So copy the code and then we can go into the components and make a new component called Theme Provider

07:40.620 --> 07:41.850
Dot TSX.

07:41.940 --> 07:44.520
And then we can again pass that code in.

07:44.520 --> 07:50.130
And then what I'm going to ask it to do is say we'll give it the components folder now.

07:50.130 --> 07:54.750
So instead of giving it the file we'll give it the components folder with.

07:54.780 --> 07:57.750
And we can do that with obviously the at symbol and go to the folders.

07:57.750 --> 08:06.350
And we'll go to components and say Update all of my components to support both light mode and dark mode.

08:06.380 --> 08:06.590
Right.

08:06.620 --> 08:11.420
So we've implemented the theme and we've provided that as the theme provider.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.650
And we're just check here.

08:12.650 --> 08:14.870
So that theme provider is a export default.

08:14.870 --> 08:15.800
So we'll go and fix that.

08:15.800 --> 08:19.430
And this is the thing with code generation is it's not exactly perfect.

08:19.430 --> 08:21.350
And you can see export function.

08:21.350 --> 08:22.670
So that is now fixed.

08:22.670 --> 08:23.930
And that should be fine.

08:23.930 --> 08:30.200
And then now it's sort of saying the dashboard header it needs to then and we'll just go and delete

08:30.200 --> 08:30.710
this.

08:30.740 --> 08:36.020
We need to then implement the the dashboard header to be like this instead.

08:36.020 --> 08:40.520
And also so it's telling us to update it to this section here.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.440
So it needs to be updated.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.960
And then we need to import the theme toggle.

08:47.330 --> 08:48.920
And we'll get rid of these ones here.

08:49.490 --> 08:51.770
And then it's saying update the sidebar.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.860
So again we can click on the sidebar code.

08:54.890 --> 08:56.930
And we can just copy that across

08:59.960 --> 09:03.170
And we will also update the overview chart.

09:03.440 --> 09:03.920
Oh yes.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.390
And we're replacing it with this section.

09:05.390 --> 09:11.270
So often the overview chart will come with this section and you'll need to update it.

09:11.990 --> 09:15.680
And then revenue chart replace it with this.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.120
That is exactly what we need.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.840
And then the theme toggle should already be theme aware.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.280
Let's just double check.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.360
Uh that looks right.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.900
Set theme.

09:38.900 --> 09:39.890
And then.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.360
All right so then let's try it.

09:41.390 --> 09:43.910
So I'm going to run the app and have a look.

09:43.940 --> 09:45.440
So we've got one error here.

09:45.470 --> 09:48.320
Unsupported server component type undefined.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.910
If we look in here attempted import layer does not contain any export default.

09:52.940 --> 09:57.620
We just need an export default function here which will then fix the theme provider.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.880
And then we've got the ability to do light mode and dark mode.

10:00.880 --> 10:05.740
It looks like we've got two of these buttons, so let's see how we can go and fix that.

10:05.740 --> 10:08.650
So that will be inside of the code base.

10:08.650 --> 10:14.020
Now what I'm going to suggest we do for this is let's get rid of all of the files inside of here.

10:14.020 --> 10:22.210
And we'll do uh, we'll get and we'll do an app code base and we'll say I currently have two files,

10:22.390 --> 10:29.080
two, um, toggles for my, um, for my dark mode.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.140
But can you reduce this to one?

10:32.830 --> 10:38.980
And as you see here, you can use a so the number of searches you can do will vary.

10:38.980 --> 10:41.020
And obviously the more will cost you more money.

10:41.020 --> 10:44.980
And you can say what files to include and the files to exclude.

10:44.980 --> 10:50.620
And whether you want to use GPT four as a reranker and have a reasoning step as well.

10:50.620 --> 10:56.890
So this is the advanced information which you can use and modify inside of code base.

10:57.190 --> 11:01.170
But what code base will do is it will go and it will read lots of different files.

11:01.170 --> 11:05.310
So you can see here it's going to be looking at different types of files.

11:05.310 --> 11:09.960
And we can see here that it's decided to do remove the import for theme foggle.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.000
So that would be inside the layout.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.910
And then you can see here we are going to remove this and I'm going to click apply.

11:18.480 --> 11:22.680
And then I'm just going to go through these suggestions and click Y.

11:22.710 --> 11:23.040
Yeah.

11:23.040 --> 11:23.970
And get rid of these.

11:23.970 --> 11:27.270
And then this theme folder provider is absolutely fine.

11:27.300 --> 11:27.720
All right.

11:27.720 --> 11:28.350
And there we go.

11:28.380 --> 11:33.780
We've added light mode and dark mode for our dashboard visualization which is great.

11:33.780 --> 11:41.010
So again we've explored where you are specifically looking at using different types of referencing.

11:41.010 --> 11:46.770
Inside of the eye chat window, we've had a look at how to fix bugs using the cursor eye chat.

11:46.770 --> 11:50.040
And remember with the At symbol you can do a range of different things.

11:50.040 --> 11:56.760
So looking at files folders, looking at the code, looking at web, looking at docs, git and codebase,

11:56.760 --> 12:03.360
the ones that I personally use a lot is the files, the folders, and the code base I find.

12:03.390 --> 12:09.240
If you're able to provide the right folders and the files, then you're always able to get better outputs

12:09.240 --> 12:13.230
from any type of large language model that you're using to help with your code generation.

12:13.260 --> 12:17.610
A quick tip that I'd just like to give you that I found really useful in my own personal projects.

12:17.640 --> 12:24.480
It's always making sure to include the database schema inside of your types of chat windows, or inside

12:24.480 --> 12:25.620
of Cursor Composer.

12:25.650 --> 12:31.020
You'll find that by including database types or strong types, you'll able to be producing code that

12:31.020 --> 12:35.760
will have a lot less errors and also need to be edited less frequently as well.

12:35.790 --> 12:39.510
In the next lesson, we're going to have a look at the different kinds of functionality that we can

12:39.510 --> 12:40.590
use in the chat window.

12:40.620 --> 12:46.320
One thing I'm particularly interested to show you is the ability to pull in custom documentation to

12:46.350 --> 12:51.150
help write code for when these large language models don't have the relevant information inside of their

12:51.150 --> 12:52.320
pre-training data.

12:52.350 --> 12:57.780
We'll be looking at integrating Lang chain and using up to date documentation to generate an effective

12:57.780 --> 12:58.770
Python script.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.240
All right, I'll see you all in the next one.
