In this video, we're going to have a look at how you can easily identify top performing models from

00:04.370 --> 00:05.270
a single table.

00:05.300 --> 00:10.520
There's a website called Chatbot Arena Board, which is LM arena AI, and this provides you with an

00:10.520 --> 00:15.800
extensive overview of all the different models that are currently top performers with their Elo rankings.

00:15.800 --> 00:20.660
We can also filter this for coding to get a better understanding as to what models are doing well for

00:20.660 --> 00:21.620
code generation.

00:21.620 --> 00:28.190
So go to the category and click on coding and then this will reload the Gradio table showing you the

00:28.190 --> 00:30.200
best performing models for coding.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.110
Given some specific data sets that they've been evaluating against.

00:33.110 --> 00:38.000
If we scroll down, you'll see that one preview apparently is the top performing model secondary to

00:38.180 --> 00:38.720
one mini.

00:38.720 --> 00:41.660
And then we also have for example chat 3.5 sonnet.

00:41.690 --> 00:47.390
Now I do recommend you actually give cloud 3.5 sonnet a go if you're doing full stack web development,

00:47.390 --> 00:51.650
because it works really well with radix Shad, CDN and Next.js app router.

00:51.650 --> 00:56.090
However, I'm also very tool agnostic and I would recommend that you keep an eye on this leaderboard

00:56.090 --> 01:01.430
over time so that you can switch inside of cursor to use whatever model is the most powerful in terms

01:01.430 --> 01:02.330
of code generation.

01:02.360 --> 01:07.310
Another website that's also good to keep in mind is the code generation on human eval dataset.

01:07.340 --> 01:11.630
If we scroll down and have a look, you can see that at the moment zero one mini is currently performing

01:11.630 --> 01:12.410
the best also.

01:12.410 --> 01:15.290
Then secondary to zero one preview GPT four zero.

01:15.320 --> 01:19.040
Then we have things like claw 3.5, sonnet and also fractal research.

01:19.040 --> 01:23.150
So don't just use one data set to decide what model to switch to.

01:23.180 --> 01:27.770
And also just because the evaluations are higher for zero one mini, you should have a play around with

01:27.770 --> 01:32.240
a couple of the best performing models to get a sense of style and flavor for what will give you the

01:32.240 --> 01:36.590
best results, I'll put both of these links inside of the video so that you can easily access them.
