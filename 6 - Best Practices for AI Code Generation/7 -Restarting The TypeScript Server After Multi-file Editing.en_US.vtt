This is just a quick video showing you how sometimes when you use composer, some of the file imports

00:04.910 --> 00:07.310
can get messed up inside of your TypeScript server.

00:07.340 --> 00:12.170
You can see here, for example we have this at components slash welcome message.

00:12.170 --> 00:16.430
Now we can clearly see that the welcome message does exist inside of this components folder.

00:16.460 --> 00:20.720
Yet we're still getting a cannot find module error inside of the TypeScript server.

00:20.750 --> 00:26.810
What you can do is when you've built a lot of files or folders using composer, restart your TypeScript

00:26.810 --> 00:27.080
server.

00:27.080 --> 00:30.590
Then you can actually find out what are the true errors inside of your project.

00:30.590 --> 00:33.500
You don't have to close cursor or VS code to do this.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.170
You can actually do this inside of cursor.

00:36.170 --> 00:40.370
So just hit Command shift P or Control shift P on windows.

00:40.370 --> 00:41.960
Then you can type TypeScript.

00:41.960 --> 00:46.640
Then just hit enter on your keyboard which will restart the TypeScript server.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.130
And now you can see that that error message has gone away.

00:49.130 --> 00:51.980
And welcome message did actually exist inside of the application.

00:51.980 --> 00:56.900
You'll want to do this when you create a lot of files in composer to really figure out which modules

00:56.900 --> 00:58.520
are actually giving you errors.

00:58.550 --> 00:59.000
Cool.

00:59.030 --> 01:00.050
I'll see you in the next video.
