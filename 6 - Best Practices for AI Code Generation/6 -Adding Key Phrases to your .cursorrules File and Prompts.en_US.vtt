Welcome back.

00:00.830 --> 00:05.630
This is just a quick video talking about some of the key phrases I found when using cursor to improve

00:05.630 --> 00:06.170
the outputs.

00:06.170 --> 00:11.120
So for example, row prompting and telling cursor to act like a ten-x engineer really does seem to have

00:11.120 --> 00:12.770
a good impact on the code quality.

00:12.770 --> 00:17.540
Also, you can use emotional prompting such as please don't be lazy or my job depends on doing this

00:17.540 --> 00:18.470
task really well.

00:18.470 --> 00:24.590
I've also found providing direction to be very useful in both prompts and also the cursor rules files.

00:24.590 --> 00:30.410
So for example saying be incredibly extensive and detailed or make sure to include error handling and

00:30.410 --> 00:31.310
all scenarios.

00:31.310 --> 00:36.380
Have a play around with these prompts in your projects and see what gives you better results.
