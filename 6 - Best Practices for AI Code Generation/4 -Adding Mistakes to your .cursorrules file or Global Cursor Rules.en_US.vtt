A common mistake that you'll run into when you're building full stack web applications with an IDE like

00:04.550 --> 00:05.090
cursor.

00:05.090 --> 00:09.470
Sometimes it won't produce the react components or the functions in your preferred style.

00:09.470 --> 00:14.810
The easy way to fix this is to make sure that as you encounter these errors or mistakes throughout your

00:14.810 --> 00:19.370
development workflow, to continually add these to the cursor rules file.

00:19.370 --> 00:20.570
So think of it like this.

00:20.570 --> 00:26.450
Whenever a cursor makes a mistake, you log that mistake in the cursor rules file, either locally for

00:26.480 --> 00:32.120
a project or globally in your cursor settings, and then over time, your cursor rules file becomes

00:32.120 --> 00:38.390
an extension of how you like to code and what types of preferred ways of styling you have for your functionality.

00:38.390 --> 00:42.140
This means that you're less likely to experiencing styling errors in the future.

00:42.140 --> 00:45.620
Let's demo this by building a react component inside of a page.

00:45.620 --> 00:47.390
So we've got an XJS application here.

00:47.390 --> 00:49.250
We've got a page dot TSX.

00:49.280 --> 00:53.990
Let's also say generate a Hello World component.

00:54.710 --> 00:56.480
And we've just used command K for this.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.780
And we can see here I've actually got a React.fc.

00:59.780 --> 01:01.850
This is a good example of good styling.

01:01.850 --> 01:05.240
Let's say we wanted to have all of our exports with export const.

01:05.270 --> 01:08.030
We could do that by updating the cursor rules okay.

01:08.060 --> 01:09.740
So we've updated the cursor rules.

01:09.740 --> 01:17.690
So giving a bad example with an export default and a good example with a return with the export const.

01:17.720 --> 01:22.670
Now we're going to try and recreate that Hello World component inside of the page TSX.

01:22.670 --> 01:29.300
So we're just going to go here and say make a new Hello World component and export it.

01:32.390 --> 01:36.770
So now you can see that cursor is immediately following our cursor rules file.

01:36.770 --> 01:41.150
So as you run into styling errors whilst you're developing your applications, add these incrementally

01:41.150 --> 01:43.640
to cursor rules so that you can avoid them in the future.
