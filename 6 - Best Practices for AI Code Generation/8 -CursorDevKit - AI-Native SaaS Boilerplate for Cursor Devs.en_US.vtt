Everyone is James here?

00:01.010 --> 00:07.100
This is just a quick video where I'm going to be giving you 100% off my personal SAS development boilerplate.

00:07.100 --> 00:11.630
The reason I'm giving this to you is because I want to give back to the developer community, and I

00:11.630 --> 00:16.760
think it's really great for you to have an easy boilerplate that will allow you to get started quickly

00:16.760 --> 00:17.690
on new projects.

00:17.690 --> 00:19.370
So what is this boilerplate come with?

00:19.400 --> 00:23.750
Well, this comes with a local super base development stack so that you'll be able to automatically

00:23.750 --> 00:27.620
build your entire setup from authentication payments and develop locally.

00:27.620 --> 00:32.990
Also, we have things such as TypeScript support, so we'll automatically regenerate all of the types

00:32.990 --> 00:35.630
whenever you make a change to your local database.

00:35.630 --> 00:40.220
Also, the boilerplate comes bundled with sentry integration, so you can easily detect and monitor

00:40.220 --> 00:42.680
edge cases and bugs directly in real time.

00:42.680 --> 00:46.190
This allows you to catch errors early so that your customers aren't going to get upset.

00:46.190 --> 00:50.180
There's also a stripe integration so that you'll be developing easily with stripe.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.920
It's already set up out of the box for you.

00:51.950 --> 00:56.780
With inside the actual repository, there is a prompts folder that allows you to easily automate lots

00:56.780 --> 00:58.880
of different tasks with markdown files.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.320
As well as that, we also provide jest tests and playwright tests inside of this boilerplate.

01:03.320 --> 01:09.350
You can also deploy these directly to GitHub actions so that you can test your application before deploying

01:09.380 --> 01:09.890
to production.

01:09.890 --> 01:13.880
This is just a promotional discount that only applies to people that have bought my Udemy course.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.860
I just want to give you a great thank you for this.

01:15.860 --> 01:21.410
And also, I think it's really unfair that all of these other Boilerplates are charging $149 and they're

01:21.410 --> 01:22.370
not cursor friendly.

01:22.370 --> 01:26.900
I've put a lot of time into building this production grade stack, and I want to keep this up to date,

01:26.900 --> 01:31.910
and I really want to make sure that this is the best stack for cursor and Superbase and Shadchan.

01:31.940 --> 01:37.370
To gain access to the boilerplate for free, just visit cursor devkit.com and then enter the Udemy Free

01:37.400 --> 01:38.240
Promotion code.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.620
When you go into stripe checkout, you'll get 100% off, so I recommend going for the most expensive

01:42.620 --> 01:43.010
plan.

01:43.040 --> 01:46.190
I'd love to get your feedback on this and enjoy the boilerplate.
