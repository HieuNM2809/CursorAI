One common problem you'll have when using Cursor Composer is that sometimes it can cause errors in your

00:05.600 --> 00:11.510
code further along down the line, or potentially it removes features as you're working in composer

00:11.510 --> 00:12.170
sessions.

00:12.200 --> 00:16.760
Now, we've simulated a bunch of errors here, and I'm going to accept all these changes.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.080
And we're going to break the code.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.630
So you can see here we've got a non-existent function.

00:20.630 --> 00:23.030
And we've also got some type errors here.

00:23.060 --> 00:28.040
Now when I try and load the next application this will then cause a bug and an error.

00:28.040 --> 00:32.510
And this is a bad thing because over time as you're using composer, sometimes it can take features

00:32.510 --> 00:34.730
out or cause errors inside of your code.

00:34.730 --> 00:40.160
So how can you easily revert back to a previous point within the composer session so that your code

00:40.160 --> 00:40.610
works?

00:40.610 --> 00:45.830
Cursor has introduced this concept of checkpoints, so if you look on the right hand side you can see

00:45.860 --> 00:47.510
we've got a checkpoint here.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.600
And we've also got a checkpoint as well here.

00:50.600 --> 00:56.840
So you can check out for example, if we go back here we can then reset all the files to this by clicking

00:56.840 --> 00:57.650
the checkout.

00:57.680 --> 01:01.550
Now if we have a look here, you'll see that all of the files have gone back.

01:01.550 --> 01:08.270
And so this is a nice easy way that you can easily revert back to a previous point in a composer session

01:08.270 --> 01:11.210
to avoid regressions or bugs within your code.

01:11.210 --> 01:16.310
Again, just to clarify, all you're doing is you're basically clicking on the on the checkpoints.

01:16.310 --> 01:20.060
So you can see here we've got checkpoints and you're clicking on that checkout button.

01:20.060 --> 01:25.400
And the checkout button allows you to reset all files to this point in the conversation.
