WEBVTT

00:00.140 --> 00:00.530
All right.

00:00.560 --> 00:05.600
Now that you've got cursor installed and you have your VSCode extensions that have been copied across

00:05.600 --> 00:10.160
potentially from VSCode, we're going to have a look at the best way that you can set up cursor to get

00:10.160 --> 00:11.300
the most out of this tool.

00:11.330 --> 00:15.680
What I want you to do is I want you to navigate to the preferences inside of cursor.

00:15.680 --> 00:21.920
So go to the settings and then you've got VSCode settings which is how you can configure your VSCode

00:21.920 --> 00:22.550
settings.

00:22.550 --> 00:26.570
We're going to go into Cursor Settings and go to general.

00:26.600 --> 00:29.150
Now I do recommend you upgrading to the Pro account.

00:29.150 --> 00:30.410
You'll get a load of free features.

00:30.410 --> 00:32.060
And they also offer a really great trial.

00:32.060 --> 00:33.200
So give that a go.

00:33.230 --> 00:37.790
As you can see here, if you need to do a re-import from VSCode, you can do that.

00:37.790 --> 00:39.320
Now this is really important.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.630
This section where you've got the rules for AI.

00:41.660 --> 00:47.450
These are the rules that cursor is going to follow as it runs any of its different types of auto completions

00:47.450 --> 00:51.680
predictions, or even using more advanced features like composer.

00:51.680 --> 00:53.810
So you can obviously add the rules here.

00:53.810 --> 00:57.530
And that will be enabled globally across all of your different cursor windows.

00:57.560 --> 01:03.020
Additionally, you can choose to add in this hidden file, which is called a cursor rules file.

01:03.020 --> 01:04.670
And you can see here we've done that.

01:04.670 --> 01:10.190
And I've added in a cursor rules specifically telling it to focus on the fact that it's an expert in

01:10.190 --> 01:13.130
Python, fast API and API scale development.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.730
You can add on some different types of things, like different types of dependencies you want it to

01:16.730 --> 01:18.590
use and key conventions.

01:18.590 --> 01:22.460
And there's a great website and that's called cursor dot directory.

01:22.460 --> 01:27.740
And you can find lots of different types of rules that people have made for different types of programming

01:27.740 --> 01:34.610
languages and frameworks that you can include either globally inside of your cursor project in the settings,

01:34.610 --> 01:36.710
or you can include as the cursor rules.

01:36.710 --> 01:42.170
Personally, I'm starting to like cursor rules, and the reason why is then I can define that on a project

01:42.170 --> 01:43.280
by project basis.

01:43.280 --> 01:44.600
I have also got privacy mode.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.310
I recommend turning that to disabled.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.280
Now let's go to another section which is the models.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.190
So here you're going to have different types of models.

01:52.190 --> 01:57.830
And my recommendation would be to turn pretty much every single model off apart from cursor Small,

01:57.860 --> 02:03.710
GPT 3.5, turbo 3.5, sonnet, and GPT four mini.

02:03.740 --> 02:09.290
My suggestion is when you're coding at the moment, this current time of recording this video is to

02:09.320 --> 02:11.510
use Claude 3.5 sonnet.

02:11.540 --> 02:17.840
I've personally been a big fan of OpenAI, but having tried Claude 3.5 sonnet, it really is great for

02:17.840 --> 02:18.380
coding.

02:18.410 --> 02:23.510
After clicking on the features tab, you want to make sure that you've got several settings enabled.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.780
For example, in the tab completion, we'll want to turn that on.

02:26.810 --> 02:29.780
I personally don't like accepting partial edits.

02:29.780 --> 02:36.560
I do have cursor prediction on, and that will basically move the cursor whenever you hit tab on the

02:36.560 --> 02:37.130
screen.

02:37.130 --> 02:39.740
So maybe there's an error halfway down your code.

02:39.740 --> 02:45.290
If you hit tab, the cursor will move and then edit that and complete that code and change that code,

02:45.290 --> 02:50.870
which can be really beneficial as the cursor can move all around the file in a different place to solve

02:50.870 --> 02:51.620
issues.

02:51.650 --> 02:57.890
Additionally, I have it on trigger in comments and I've I also turned on auto import, which allows

02:57.890 --> 03:02.120
you to automatically add imports if you're using TypeScript or Python.

03:02.150 --> 03:06.770
The next thing that you'll want to make sure that is turned on is composer, which allows you to do

03:06.800 --> 03:08.210
multi file editing.

03:08.240 --> 03:14.990
I also recommend turning on always keep composer inbound and also command p for file picker and show

03:14.990 --> 03:16.340
suggested files.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.640
We'll come on to code based indexing in a future video.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.410
But for now we can leave that aside.

03:21.410 --> 03:28.490
You can easily add custom documentation which allows you to supplement the LLM with additional knowledge,

03:28.490 --> 03:30.440
just in case a new package has come out.

03:30.440 --> 03:35.360
And the LLM doesn't really know about that package that well, this can be a great way for you to add

03:35.360 --> 03:39.050
in extra information which will improve your code generation.

03:39.050 --> 03:45.050
For example, we can click add a new doc and then you can type in a doc reference here I've just chosen

03:45.050 --> 03:49.010
Lang Chain and you can see what will happen is it will try and find the prefix of that.

03:49.010 --> 03:53.540
And then after we then put that in, what it will do is it will then index that Information.

03:53.570 --> 03:59.120
Also, I'm just going to give it a unique name and then that documentation will be added in and indexed.

03:59.150 --> 04:02.600
Additionally, there's other things you can do with your custom documentation.

04:02.600 --> 04:07.040
So if you want to reindex the documentation, just hit the spinning arrow here.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.320
Also, as well as that, you can also delete docs.

04:09.350 --> 04:15.590
Now for the chat section I don't recommend turning on always search the web or fade chat stream or default

04:15.620 --> 04:16.850
node context.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.330
I do recommend having a narrow chat bar, auto scroll show, chat history show, suggested files, and

04:23.330 --> 04:27.440
I don't also have the collapse input box pills for the editor.

04:27.440 --> 04:33.500
I always choose to show that as an editor tooltip, and also I recommend passing the inline edit links,

04:33.500 --> 04:37.400
which will automatically pass links when you pass them in with the command K.

04:37.430 --> 04:40.040
Also do have auto select on for the terminal.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.720
I recommend having the terminal hint on and also show terminal hover hint for the beta section.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.810
Turn all of these on and we'll explore them in future lessons.

04:47.810 --> 04:51.770
In the next video, you're going to learn about how you can easily download all of the course content

04:51.770 --> 04:52.430
via GitHub.
