In this video, I'm just going to be giving you a cheat sheet so that you can easily reference all the

00:04.260 --> 00:07.590
keyboard shortcuts for cursor as you go through the course.

00:07.590 --> 00:10.560
This is a downloadable resource, so feel free to download this.

00:10.560 --> 00:15.180
Hopefully it gives you a bit of feel for the different types of features that are inside of cursor,

00:15.180 --> 00:20.820
and also giving you a reference for all the different types of keyboard shortcuts that you can use to

00:20.850 --> 00:23.730
improve your development workflow using cursor.
