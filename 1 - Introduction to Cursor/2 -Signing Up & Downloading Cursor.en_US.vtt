To sign up to cassette, go to the top right on the website cursor.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.650
Com and click on the sign in button.

00:06.680 --> 00:11.510
After you've clicked this button, you can either sign in if you already have a Google account or a

00:11.540 --> 00:12.140
GitHub.

00:12.140 --> 00:14.150
If you want to do an email address, sign up.

00:14.150 --> 00:15.170
Click on the sign up.

00:15.170 --> 00:20.210
I already have a Google account, so I'm going to sign in with Google by clicking the Google button.

00:26.630 --> 00:30.860
After signing in to your account, you'll see a couple of basic settings such as your name and also

00:30.890 --> 00:32.120
your model usage.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.380
I want to draw your attention to the model usage because this is quite important if you start getting

00:36.380 --> 00:37.730
into API rate limits.

00:37.730 --> 00:43.580
So you can see, for example, out of the premium models, which is GPT four, GPT four and Claude 3.5

00:43.610 --> 00:43.970
sonnet.

00:43.970 --> 00:51.260
At this time, I've used 824 out of my 1000 requests, so if I was to use up a thousand requests, I'd

00:51.260 --> 00:53.090
have to buy additional requests.

00:53.090 --> 00:58.280
When using cursor, you get an unlimited amount when you buy the Pro subscription.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.860
For the smaller models, such as GPT four or mini.

01:00.860 --> 01:04.280
So that is one consideration that you'll want to be bearing in mind.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.900
And also, if you run out of requests, you can buy the number of false requests.

01:08.900 --> 01:13.880
So I can add on an additional 1500 requests for $20 a month.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.380
My suggestion would be to trial cursor for at least a week or two weeks.

01:18.380 --> 01:23.540
Instead of using something like VSCode, give it a bit of quality time to really test whether this tool

01:23.540 --> 01:25.550
is going to speed up your development workflow.

01:25.550 --> 01:30.290
To download cursor, all you have to now do is click on the top right button, which will take you to

01:30.320 --> 01:33.170
download, and it will download your relevant installer.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.850
Given your operating system.

01:34.880 --> 01:41.390
After you've downloaded it, follow the setup instructions and remember to import any VSCode extensions

01:41.390 --> 01:43.940
that you have so that you can utilize those.

01:43.940 --> 01:48.020
In the next video, we'll go over the recommended settings so you can get the most out of cursor.
