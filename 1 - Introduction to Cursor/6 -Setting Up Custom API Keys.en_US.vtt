00:00.000 --> 00:00.270
All right.

00:00.270 --> 00:00.870
Welcome back.

00:00.870 --> 00:05.670
So in this video we're going to have a quick look at how you can add custom API keys into your cursor

00:05.670 --> 00:06.330
setup.

00:06.360 --> 00:09.030
Go to cursor at the top click on settings.

00:09.030 --> 00:10.500
Go to Cursor Settings.

00:10.500 --> 00:13.350
And then what you'll want to do is go to the models page.

00:13.350 --> 00:19.020
Inside the models page you can see you can add different types of keys and anthropic API key, a Google

00:19.020 --> 00:21.000
API key, or an Azure API key.

00:21.060 --> 00:27.480
Now all you have to do is take your API key from the provider, and then you can add this API key on.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.610
And then you'll just have to hit this here.

00:29.640 --> 00:35.370
Now if you're using Cursor Pro, you don't need to use your API key unless you're using custom models.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.680
Now the point I'll just make on this is you should only use an OpenAI API key, or an anthropic, or

00:40.710 --> 00:44.220
a Google or Azure key if you're not using Cursor Pro.

00:44.250 --> 00:49.170
If you're using Cursor Pro, I really wouldn't recommend using an API key.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.450
It can be slightly more expensive.

00:51.450 --> 00:57.030
And also, for example, some of the features, such as the composer mode is not available to use when

00:57.030 --> 01:02.940
we have a specific type of using a custom API, you'll find that the composer won't work, and the reason

01:02.940 --> 01:06.750
why that it won't work is that it's using the custom API key.

01:06.750 --> 01:07.620
So composer.

01:07.620 --> 01:13.050
If you want to use more advanced features like composer, you can't use an API key.

01:13.140 --> 01:17.820
Um, and I really would recommend using composer and we'll get into that later on in the lessons.
