Hi.

00:00.290 --> 00:00.950
Welcome back.

00:00.950 --> 00:03.650
And in this lesson we're going to talk about code base indexing.

00:03.650 --> 00:08.900
Code base indexing is a native feature that's supported by cursor, which will basically index all of

00:08.900 --> 00:13.460
your individual files and create a numerical representation of what that file is.

00:13.490 --> 00:19.400
It will then use Reranking algorithms to basically pull back relevant code that is relevant to your

00:19.400 --> 00:23.000
query or your asking question inside of cursor.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.070
This helps cursor produce better code generation, and you can have a look at this feature by going

00:28.100 --> 00:30.050
into cursor and looking at the settings.

00:30.050 --> 00:31.340
Let's have a look at how to do that.

00:31.340 --> 00:35.630
Now firstly, go up to the top left and then go into Cursor settings.

00:35.630 --> 00:37.220
And then from Cursor settings.

00:37.220 --> 00:42.680
What we're then going to do is go to the beaches and we'll have a look at code base indexing.

00:42.680 --> 00:46.580
And you can see it's using these embeddings to improve your code base wide answers.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.350
All code is stored locally.

00:48.350 --> 00:50.690
You can even resync the index by clicking this.

00:50.690 --> 00:54.830
You can also have a look at settings and you can see these are the ignore files as well.

00:54.830 --> 00:56.720
And index new folders by default.

00:56.720 --> 01:03.300
And you can configure the ignored files with a cursor ignore file as well so you can add specific different

01:03.300 --> 01:05.040
files to your cursor.

01:05.070 --> 01:05.610
Ignore.

01:05.610 --> 01:09.780
And that will mean that those files are not picked up by code base indexing.

01:09.780 --> 01:12.300
Now what types of files might you want to do?

01:12.330 --> 01:18.690
You might want to exclude packages, for example in a specifically NodeJS or JavaScript or TypeScript

01:18.690 --> 01:19.290
environments.

01:19.290 --> 01:25.020
You'll definitely want to exclude the node modules folder as this would bloat your code base indexing.

01:25.020 --> 01:27.000
Let's have a look at how we can also do that.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.500
You'll see that I've opted to use the.

01:28.770 --> 01:33.300
Gitignore file, and I've added the node modules to the top of my file.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.280
I've also got a bunch of individual.

01:35.310 --> 01:39.450
You'll also see that I've got a bunch of individual different types of files or folders which need to

01:39.450 --> 01:40.470
be excluded for Python.

01:40.470 --> 01:41.760
Now why can we put this inside of the.

01:41.790 --> 01:43.770
Gitignore and how does this work?

01:43.770 --> 01:48.450
If you have a look at Cursor's documentation, if you have any large content files, you can ignore

01:48.450 --> 01:49.080
those files.

01:49.080 --> 01:55.890
So you can either use a cursor, ignore file or by default cursor will ignore all of the same files

01:55.890 --> 01:56.670
inside of your.

01:56.910 --> 01:57.570
Gitignore.

01:57.570 --> 02:02.790
So if you already have a gitignore, then you're all good for setting up code base indexing appropriately.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.090
All right.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.380
Cool I'll see you in the next one.
