Hey, welcome.

00:00.680 --> 00:05.060
And in this video we're going to have a look at command K the inline editor that you can use inside

00:05.060 --> 00:05.570
of cursor.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.960
We've looked at it a couple of times before, but I've got a Python file here.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.040
And you'll also have that same Python file if you want to practice a little bit, get really familiar

00:13.040 --> 00:14.390
with using that inline editor.

00:14.390 --> 00:19.250
Then you can obviously you can select we've got a couple of different functions here like greet calculate

00:19.250 --> 00:21.470
area, generate password and Fibonacci.

00:21.470 --> 00:22.820
And we've got a couple of to do's.

00:22.820 --> 00:25.640
So we could either even just do it here.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.500
We don't even need to do an inline edit.

00:27.500 --> 00:31.760
We can literally just say upgrade greet to handle multiple names and different languages.

00:31.760 --> 00:36.560
And cursor is clever enough to know that it needs to generate a new Python function.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.540
So that's how you can use it for generation.

00:38.540 --> 00:44.330
But we could reject that, and we could actually highlight the function that we want to change.

00:44.330 --> 00:46.610
So we can either generate or we can edit.

00:46.610 --> 00:49.070
So then let's do this submit the edit.

00:53.540 --> 00:55.460
And then you can see here this is the diff.

00:55.460 --> 00:58.340
So the red is getting deleted and the green is getting accepted.

00:58.340 --> 01:03.470
And again I'm really happy with this So in a mac you can just hit command enter on windows.

01:03.470 --> 01:04.730
That would be control enter.

01:04.730 --> 01:05.750
And then there we have it.

01:05.780 --> 01:07.310
We've refactored our code.

01:07.310 --> 01:08.960
Let's also do another couple.

01:08.960 --> 01:10.250
So we could say update.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.210
So we've got rid of this one.

01:11.210 --> 01:13.760
We could add input validation to calculate area.

01:13.760 --> 01:17.000
And also we could do this one here and we could do two at the same time.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.020
So we could select two functions and we could add a couple of these to do.

01:21.020 --> 01:23.930
And then we can see that this will then rewrite that code.

01:23.930 --> 01:27.110
And as you can see here we're getting really nice properly formatted docstrings.

01:27.110 --> 01:29.780
And we can also then just click accept.

01:29.780 --> 01:33.650
And then we've also got the final one which is optimizing Fibonacci.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.420
And as you can see you can easily refactor entire functions in just a couple of seconds.

01:38.420 --> 01:40.850
So again that's really quite quite nice.

01:40.850 --> 01:46.190
One other thing you can be aware of when you're doing inline edits is you can also do other things.

01:46.190 --> 01:50.060
So if I was to select the functions we can still do those app references.

01:50.090 --> 01:55.730
Imagine you've got some other files, maybe custom documentation, or you want to reference a chat session.

01:55.730 --> 01:57.410
It's possible to do all of that.

01:57.440 --> 02:02.420
Be aware that inline editing you're probably going to be using that to refactor functions, classes,

02:02.420 --> 02:08.990
or service files, but you can still pull in additional files, code, or documentation.

02:08.990 --> 02:14.000
That can be an easy way to stay in the flow of coding, but not necessarily have to use the chat session.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.910
And the good thing about inline editing is you get the diffs so you can easily reject or accept the

02:19.910 --> 02:22.670
differences in the code that get generated in real time.

02:22.820 --> 02:23.240
Cool.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.830
So that was an introduction.

02:24.860 --> 02:28.010
Next we're going to be looking in greater detail at composer.

02:28.040 --> 02:28.580
I'll see you there.
